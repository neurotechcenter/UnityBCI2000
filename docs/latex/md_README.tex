\doxylink{classUnityBCI2000}{Unity\+BCI2000} depends on the BCI2000\+Remote\+NET library, located at \href{https://github.com/neurotechcenter/BCI2000RemoteNET}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub}} or \href{https://www.nuget.org/packages/BCI2000RemoteNET}{\texttt{ Nu\+Get}}. Keep in mind that at the moment both BCI2000\+Remote\+NET and \doxylink{classUnityBCI2000}{Unity\+BCI2000} are not fully released, and are still in development, so features and API structure are subject to change at any time, and bugs are to be expected.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Description}{Description}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
BCI2000 is a set of programs for brain and brain-\/computer interface research. ~\newline
 \doxylink{classUnityBCI2000}{Unity\+BCI2000} provides an interface througn which one can control and interact with BCI2000 from a Unity application. \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
Add the {\ttfamily Unity\+BCI2000.\+cs} script to one {\ttfamily Game\+Object}. This is the central script which communicates with BCI2000. ~\newline
 Before starting, you must set the operator and modules to start up, by specifying the fields {\ttfamily Operator\+Path} and {\ttfamily Module\mbox{[}1-\/3\mbox{]}}. All other properties have default settings and will function without change. ~\newline
 If you also have modules started within a running BCI2000 instance, set {\ttfamily Dont\+Start\+Modules} to {\ttfamily true}, this will preserve your running modules.
