Consists of a class, {\ttfamily BCI2000\+Remote}, which handles connection and communication with BCI2000\textquotesingle{}s operator by sending commands over tcp, essentially an automated command line.\hypertarget{md_BCI2000RemoteNET_2README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Commmunication}{Commmunication}}\label{md_BCI2000RemoteNET_2README_autotoc_md2}
BCI2000\+Remote communicates with BCI2000 over tcp by sending \href{https://www.bci2000.org/mediawiki/index.php/User_Reference:Operator_Module_Scripting}{\texttt{ Operator Scripting Commands}} and receiving and processing responses. After sending a command, BCI2000\+Remote will usually receive either a \textquotesingle{}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\textquotesingle{} (Prompt), if the command produces no output and no errors, the output of the command, or any error that the command produces.\hypertarget{md_BCI2000RemoteNET_2README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Options and Properties}{Options and Properties}}\label{md_BCI2000RemoteNET_2README_autotoc_md3}
{\ttfamily Timeout} The timeout, in milliseconds, for sending and receiving commands, default 1000.

{\ttfamily Telnet\+IP} The IP at which to connect to the Operator, default 127.\+0.\+0.\+1 Note\+: Don\textquotesingle{}t use "{}localhost"{} when setting this, as this causes errors due to ambiguity in name resolution.

{\ttfamily Telnet\+Port} The port to connect to the Operator, default 3999.

{\ttfamily Operator\+Path} The path to the Operator module to start up when there is no running operator at the IP and port specified, will always connect on localhost, at the previously given port.

{\ttfamily Log\+File} The path to the file to write the log. This is overwritten on {\ttfamily Connect()}, default "{}log\+File.\+txt"{}, in the working directory of the calling application.

{\ttfamily Log\+States} Whether or not to log commands to set a state, as well as the received Prompt if the command produces no errors, default false.

{\ttfamily Log\+Prompts} Whether or not to log any Prompt, in which case only received output and errors will be logged, default false.

{\ttfamily Stop\+On\+Quit} Whether or not to stop the Operator run when ending BCI2000\+Remote, default true.

{\ttfamily Disconnect\+On\+Quit} Whether or not to disconnect from and/or terminate the Operator module when ending BCI2000\+Remote, default true.\hypertarget{md_BCI2000RemoteNET_2README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Logging and Debugging Properties}{Logging and Debugging Properties}}\label{md_BCI2000RemoteNET_2README_autotoc_md4}
All of these properties are written to the {\ttfamily Log\+File} whenever they are changed, except for the cases set by {\ttfamily Log\+States} and {\ttfamily Log\+Prompts}.

{\ttfamily Result} The result of a method, usually represents any error in execution of a method. Always set either by the instance of BCI2000\+Remote it is a member of, and reset whenever {\ttfamily Execute()} is called.

{\ttfamily Sending} The command being sent to the operator.

{\ttfamily Received} The received data from the operator after a command is sent, as a string. Set whenever {\ttfamily Execute()} is called.

{\ttfamily Response} The received data after it has been processed by BCI2000\+Remote. Generally only for internal use.\hypertarget{md_BCI2000RemoteNET_2README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Methods}{Methods}}\label{md_BCI2000RemoteNET_2README_autotoc_md5}
All methods return a boolean representing their successful execution, while any data output is handled by passing in a reference.

{\ttfamily Connect()} Attempts to connect to a running operator at {\ttfamily Telnet\+Ip\+:Telnet\+Port}, then attempts to start the operator at {\ttfamily Operator\+Path}, and connect at {\ttfamily 127.\+0.\+0.\+1\+:Telnet\+Port}.

{\ttfamily Disconnect()} Terminates operator if it was started by a previous {\ttfamily Connect()} call, then closes tcp connection.

{\ttfamily Connected()} Returns whether {\ttfamily BCI2000\+Remote} is connected to the operator.

{\ttfamily Startup\+Modules(Dictionary\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}string module, List\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}string\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} arguments\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>})} Starts up modules in the Operator\textquotesingle{}s directory. Takes a dictionary of type \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}string, List$<$string$>$\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}, with the keys being the module name, and the values being whatever command line arguments are being passed to the module. Automatically appends "{}-\/-\/"{} to the beginning of arguments and "{}-\/-\/local"{} to the list of arguments. Pass null to arguments to only run modules with --local

{\ttfamily Load\+Parameters\+Remote(string path)} Loads parameters from a file on the Operator\textquotesingle{}s machine.

{\ttfamily Load\+Parameters\+Local(string path)} Loads parameters from a local parameter file Might not work at the moment, recommended to use {\ttfamily Load\+Parameters\+Remote} if running operator locally.

{\ttfamily Set\+Parameter(string name, string value)} Sets a parameter to a value.

{\ttfamily Get\+Parameter(string name, ref string value)} Gets a parameter\textquotesingle{}s value, and stores it in the given string reference.

{\ttfamily Start()} Starts a new run of the operator.

{\ttfamily Stop()} Stops the operator if it is running.

{\ttfamily Add\+State\+Variable(string name, int bit\+Width, double starting\+Value)} Adds a state variable.

{\ttfamily Set\+State\+Variable(string name, double value)} Sets a state variable.

{\ttfamily Get\+State\+Variable(string name, ref double value)} Gets a state variable\textquotesingle{}s value and stores it at the given reference.

{\ttfamily Get\+System\+State(ref string state)} Gets the system\textquotesingle{}s state, and stores it at the given reference.

{\ttfamily Execute(string command, optional ref int out\+Code)} Executes a given command. The out\+Code is used when a command returns a value that is easily interpretable as true or false, in which case it will be 1 for true and 0 for false, or -\/1 for anything not interpretable. If the command returns a number for an exit code, the out\+Code will be 0. This is reversed from the original BCI2000\+Remote due to \doxylink{namespaceBCI2000RemoteNET}{BCI2000\+Remote\+NET} using 1 to represent true and success, and to avoid confusion about 0 being true. If a command needs to return something other than an exit code, don\textquotesingle{}t use out\+Code, as the response will be stored at {\ttfamily Received} or {\ttfamily Response}. In most cases the override {\ttfamily Execute(string command)} will be used.
